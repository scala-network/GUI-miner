## **Compiling on Linux (Ubuntu)**

Compiling on Linux will generate the binaries for Windows, macOS and Linux.

The miner GUI is built using [Electron](https://electronjs.org) and
[Go](https://golang.org) using the
[Astilectron app framework](https://github.com/asticode/astilectron).

### **Install dependencies**

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc make python libmicrohttpd10 libnss3 -y
```

- gcc and make are required for go packages  
- python is required for GUI-miner  
- libmicrohttpd is required for xmrig  
- libnss3 is required for electron  

### **Install Go**

1. [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/)

2. or follow the next lines

download and unpack golang binaries

```shell
cd ~
wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.11.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.11.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

add Go to current $PATH, by editing the current user's `.bashrc`

```shell
nano ~/.bashrc 
```

add the following

```shell
# golang
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin
```

run the .bashrc file (otherwise you need to logout and login again for it to get triggered)

```shell
source ~/.bashrc
```

now you could check the go installation by running

```shell
go version
```

### Clone the app

```shell
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/furiousteam/BLOC-GUI-Miner.git
```

### Install required Go packages

```shell
go get -u github.com/asticode/go-astilectron
go get -u github.com/asticode/go-astilectron-bundler/...
go get -u github.com/asticode/go-astichartjs
go get -u github.com/asticode/go-astilectron-bootstrap
go get -u github.com/google/uuid
go get -u github.com/mitchellh/go-ps
go get -u github.com/furiousteam/BLOC-GUI-Miner/src/gui
go get -u github.com/konsorten/go-windows-terminal-sequences
go get -u github.com/mattn/go-colorable
```

### Update electron version

edit `~/go/src/github.com/asticode/go-astilectron/astilectron.go` file

```shell
nano ~/go/src/github.com/asticode/go-astilectron/astilectron.go
```

and change `VersionElectron         = "1.8.1"` to `VersionElectron         = "3.0.8"`

then, recompile go-astilectron-bundler

```shell
cd ~/go/src/github.com/asticode/go-astilectron-bundler
make
```

### Compile the miner

```shell
cd ~/BLOC-GUI-Miner
make
```

If all goes well, the binaries for Windows, macOS and Linux will be available in the `bin` folder.

### Attach the miner

before you start the GUI-miner, make sure you have copied the binaries of [xmrig](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig) or [xmr-stak](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak) into the `miner` subfolder right next to the main GUI-miner executable

## **Make sure you have a wallet**

You need to [create your wallet](https://wiki.bloc.money/wallets/Making-a-Wallet) before start mining.

We offer different possibility for you to create a **BLOC wallet** once you start the BLOC GUI Miner and follow the installation process.

If you would like to use the BLOC GUI Miner to mine other cryptocurrency than BLOC please prepare your wallet address to use for mining.

## **I have my own miner**<a name="use-my-binaries"></a>

You are welcome to use your own [xmr-stak](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak) or [xmrig](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig) binaries as long as it is the same version compatible with the BLOC GUI Miner available on this page.

Use the standard procedure to compile your favorite miner and place the binaries file inside the **miner** folder next to the BLOC GUI Miner application. Once you are ready simply double click the **BLOC GUI Miner** icon to launch the application and [start mining](hhttps://wiki.bloc.money/mining/bloc-gui-miner-using/#start-mining).

For the mining stats to display correctly you need to enable the API for each miner by doing the following:

Compiling XMR-STAK with option: **-DMICROHTTPD_ENABLE=ON**

Ensure you have the following in you config.txt file

`"httpd_port" : 16000,`

Compiling XMRIG with option: by default **-DWITH_HTTPD=ON** should be enabled.

Ensure you have the following in you config.json file
```
"api":{
  "port":16000,
  "access-token":null,
  "worker-id":null
}
```

## **Mining Tuning Intensity and threads configuration**

### XMR-STAK

[xmr-stak](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak) gives too many options for tuning to get the best results out of your hardware. By default the miner creates config file for **CPU**, **NVIDIA** and **AMD GPU**. You can edit the values within these text files and see which works best for your mining hardware. Change the value of intensity, work-size, threads and blocks. You can add more GPUs and also lower the power mode of your CPU.

XMR-Stak will save your configuration in **config.txt** in the same directory from which it was first run.

Your configuration for pools(algorithm to mine, address, port etc) will be saved in **pools.txt**
The configuration of the device it mines(CPU/AMD/NVIDIA) will be saved in **cpu.txt**, **amd.txt** or **nvidia.txt**, respectively.

For more information on Tuning and configuring your hardware in XMR-stak we suggest you to read [this guide](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak/blob/master/doc/tuning.md)

### XMRIG

Your configuration for pools(algorithm to mine, address, port etc) will be saved in **config.json** inside the miner folder.
Use [config.xmrig.com](https://config.xmrig.com/xmrig) to generate, edit and compare configurations so you can edit your own files inside the miner folder.

## **Default Developer Donation**

### XMR-STAK

By default, the XMR-STAK will donate 2% of the hashpower (2 minutes in 100 minutes) to XMR-stak developers pool.
If you want to change that, edit [donate-level.hpp](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak/blob/master/xmrstak/donate-level.hpp) before you build the binaries.

### XMRRIG

By default, the XMRIG will donate 5% of the hashpower (5 minutes in 100 minutes) to XMRIG developers pool.
If you want to change that, edit `config.json` before you start mining.

The BLOC GUI Miner did not change this settings as we are using the binaries from the official XMRSTAK and XMRIG GitHub rep except for macOS that was built by us and we recommend to keep the donation level as it is to support the developers of both miners.
